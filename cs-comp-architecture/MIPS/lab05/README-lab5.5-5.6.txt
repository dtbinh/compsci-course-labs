README lab5.5-
** used MARS simulator to create & load/initalize
** NOTE: exit program instructions need to be syscall for exit

lab5.5
- declaration of new variable word2
- stores in registers
- swap most and least significant bytes of new word variable

lab5.6
- uses lab4.2.asm as template
- prompts user to enter integer, stores as user1
- calls procedure which reverses bytes of address of arg passed
- prints message “If bytes were layer in reverse order the number would be: “
- prints the num whose bytes have been reversed

OUTPUT EXAMPLE lab5.6:
Enter last 4 digits of SSN: -1
If the bytes were layed in reverse order the number would be: -1

Enter last 4 digits of SSN: 16777216
If the bytes were layed in reverse order the number would be: 1

Enter last 4 digits of SSN: 1
If the bytes were layed in reverse order the number would be: 16777216

Enter last 4 digits of SSN: 1773
If the bytes were layed in reverse order the number would be: -318373888
