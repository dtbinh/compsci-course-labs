README Lab 4.1 - 4.4
** used QtSPIM to load/initialize .asm files

lab4.1.asm & lab4.2.asm
- shows basic operations of jump command in conjunction with stack
- 4.1 makes use of saved registers when jumping (s0-s7)
- 4.2 makes use of the stack

lab4.3.asm
- similar to 4.1 in the usage of registers to store number values
- passes numbers to method largest which then returns that value to main

lab4.4.asm
- similar to 4.3 except uses only stacks
