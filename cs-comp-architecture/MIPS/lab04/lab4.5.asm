# This procedure computes the factorial of a non-negative integer

# The result (a 32 bit integer) is returned in $v0
# The procedure uses none of the registers $s0 - $s7 so no need to save them
# Any parameter that will make the factorial compute a result larger than
# 32 bits will return a wrong result.
