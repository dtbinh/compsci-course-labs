README - Lab 11
Comparison of Sorting Algorithms
- Eclipse IDE used to create/build/run
StudentSorter.java contains 3 sorting algorithms
TimeSorting.java implements sorting algorithms
TestSortMethods.java tests to see if array actually sorted
Student.java class instances used to store student info from students.dat
- uses comparison sorting Bubble sort, Insertion sort and Selection sort 
- input file of students.dat used as sorting target
- sorted in descending order starting with name, first name, middle name & if 
necessary student ID number (all names match)
- elapsed time is measured & output for each sorting algorithm

NOTE: output is based on seconds, which was requested in assignment description
- made all of the seconds to 3 significant figures

OUTPUT:
Bubble sort of data file takes 0.588 seconds
Insertion sort of data file takes 0.0481 seconds
Selection sort of data file takes 0.184 seconds
